# arduinoAlarmMonitor

**Purpose**
The software is used to monitor the status of an Chuango (in Denmark: 'Sikkerthjem') alarm.

**Platform**
The software is running on an Arduino Nano with ENC28J60 Ethernet Shield.

**Library**
The software seems to run equally well with 
https://github.com/ntruchsess/arduino_uip
https://github.com/UIPEthernet/UIPEthernet

The later library is larger and has more recent updates, so for now I am sticking with that.
